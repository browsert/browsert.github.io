            Game theory is the study of <em>interdependent</em> choice and action.
            It includes the study of <em>strategic decision making</em>, the
            analysis of how the choices and decisions of a rational agent depend
            on (or should be influenced by) the choices of other agents, as well
            as the study of <em>group dynamics</em>, the analysis of how the
            distribution of strategies in a population evolves in various contexts
            and how these distributions impact the outcomes of individual
            interactions. It should be distinguished from
             <a href="../decision-theory/"><em>decision theory</em></a>,
             the study of individual choice in contexts where the agent is
            choosing independently of other agents, and from
             <a href="../social-choice/"><em>social choice theory</em></a>,
             the study of collective decision making. Our focus will be on the
            relevance of game theory to ethics and political philosophy. For a
            thorough discussion of game theory and its relevance to other areas of
            philosophy see the entry on
             <a href="../game-theory/"><em>game theory</em></a>.</p>

            We can distinguish between two ways in which game theory is relevant
            to ethics. The first is <em>explanatory</em>. Game theoretic tools can
            be used to explain things ranging from (i) the function of morality
            and (ii) general features of our moral practices, to (iii) the
            dynamics of morally or politically significant social issues and (iv)
            the emergence, existence, and stability of particular moral norms. The
            second way in which game theory is relevant to ethics is
            <em>justificatory</em>. Here game theoretic tools are used to justify
            things ranging from (i) particular norms or principles, to (ii) large
            scale social institutions, or (iii) general characteristics of our
            moral practices. In what follows, we shall consider each of these
            uses, including the ways in which the former complement the
            latter.</p>

            John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern laid the foundations of
            classical game theory in their treatise <em>Theory of Games and
            Economic Behavior</em> (von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern 1944). Following
            a series of refinements published in the 1950s by numerous theorists,
            most notably John Nash, game theory then transformed social science
            over the course of the next several decades. <em>Noncooperative game
            theory</em>, the more fundamental branch of game theory, explores
            scenarios where the results of an agent&rsquo;s actions depend upon
            what other agents do, and where agents lack external mechanisms for
            enforcing agreements. More precisely, it provides a model of how
            agents satisfying certain criteria of rationality interact in
            <em>games</em> characterized by the <em>actions</em> or
            <em>strategies</em> available to each of the agents and the
            <em>payoffs</em> they can achieve. Payoffs in such scenarios are a
            product of the <em>joint strategy profile</em> that is defined by the
            actions independently chosen by the respective agents and the
            <em>state</em> of the world that obtains which reflects aspects of the
            game that are variable and over which no agent has control. Many
            scenarios in noncooperative game theory can be fruitfully analyzed
            using <em>ordinal preferences</em> constructed from agents&rsquo;
            rankings of possible outcomes. However, von Neumann and Morgenstern
            also introduced a theory of <em>cardinal utility</em> that provides a
            more precise account of payoffs by using agents&rsquo; preferences
            over lotteries to reflect how much agents prefer one outcome to
            another. Utilizing this framework, a more varied set of solution
            concepts was developed to predict how games would be played, and to
            determine when individual agents are employing optimal strategies and
            what the consequences of this are for the set of all agents.</p>
            
            <p>
            One of the most widely utilized solution concepts is the <em>Nash
            equilibrium</em>. Based upon the <em>Bayesian rationality</em>
            criterion according to which one chooses so as to maximize her
            expected utility, a Nash equilibrium is a profile of strategies
            adopted by a set of agents in which the strategy adopted by each agent
            maximizes her respective payoff given the probabilistically
            independent strategies adopted by other agents. In other words, at a
            Nash equilibrium each agent&rsquo;s strategy is a best response to the
            others&rsquo; strategies, so that none can do better by acting
            differently given what others are doing. Although Nash was not the
            first to introduce this equilibrium concept, its broad applicability
            was recognized only after Nash refined the concept and proved that if
            a noncooperative game has finitely many pure strategy profiles, then
            at least one Nash equilibrium always exists. Prior to Nash&rsquo;s
            proof it was widely known that many games lack a Nash equilibrium in
            <em>pure strategies</em> where each agent optimally responds to what
            every other agent does by adopting one of the actions available to
            her. This initially limited the class of problems to which the concept
            could be applied, but Nash showed that in such cases there will always
            be a Nash equilibrium in <em>mixed strategies</em> were each agent
            optimally responds to what other agents do by choosing among a subset
            of the strategies available to her with some probability. The
            usefulness of this concept would then be further extended by
            subsequent refinements, including most notably those made by John
            Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten (see, e.g., Harsanyi &amp; Selten
            1988).</p>
