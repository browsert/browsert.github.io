    <h1 id="title">REGIOMONTANUS' ANGLE MAXIMIZATION PROMLEM</h1>

    <div id="abstract">
        <p><strong>Abstract. </strong>This is a solved walkthrough of a famous optimization problem. This proof lies on
            elementary geometry concepts already documented in Euclid’s Elements. The problem goes like this: A
            Spacecraft flies through the solar system in what can be considered a straight line. Given the distance
            earth-sun, at what point of the spacecraft’s trajectory should the occupants perceive the biggest angle
            earth-sun. The objective is to maximize the angle subtended by the segment earth-sun and whose vertex is at
            the occupant’s eye.

        principle can be derived after some thought. And even If, the solution sinks better if you have struggled.

    <p>{1} The locus of all equal angles subtended by the same fixed segment is a double arc. This derives from the
        inscribed angle theorem which states that an angle \alpha inscribed in a circle is half the central angle
        2\alpha that subtends the same chord on the circle.
        The radius of the arc is inversely proportional to the inscribed angle it houses. The objective is to find the
        smallest circle tangent to the flight path h and passing through A & B.
        The lies on the perpendicular bisector g formed by A & B.
        The radius of the circle is the distance j from C to E.

    <p>L=c_1\times h; L is one of the two solutions. Being -L the other one. This only applies to lines perpendicular to
        segment \bar{AB}.
        For every other case where h & \bar{AB} are non-perpendicular there is only one solution and the same reasoning
        applies, we find a circle knowing two of its points and a tangent line. We can use a parabola with a focus in A
        or B and directrix h. The parabola gives us the locus of points equidistant from both the focus and its
        directrix. c_1=p\times g

        The locus of every solution with h trough C forms a circle f with diameter p . The diameter can be derived from
        the perpendicular example.
