The diversity, complexity, and adaptation of the biological realm
is evident. Until Darwin, the best explanation for these three
features of the biological was the conclusion of the &ldquo;argument
from design.&rdquo; Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection
provides an explanation of all three of these features of the
biological realm without adverting to some mysterious designing
entity, by explaining the process of &ldquo;the survival of the
fittest.&rdquo; But this explanation&rsquo;s success turns on the
meaning of its central explanatory concept,
&lsquo;fitness&rsquo;. Moreover, since Darwinian theory provides the
resources for a purely causal account of teleology, wherever it is
manifested, its reliance on the concept of &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; makes
it imperative that conceptual problems threatening the explanatory
legitimacy of this notion be solved.</p>

<h2><a id="ClaProFit">1. The Classical Problem of Fitness</a></h2>

<p> 

The leading idea of Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection is
often expressed in terms first coined by Herbert Spencer as the claim
that among competing organisms the fittest survive (1864, 144). If
there is random variation among the traits of organisms, and if some
variant traits fortuitously confer advantages on the organisms that
bear them, i.e., enhance their fitness, then those organisms will live
to have more offspring, which in turn will bear the advantageous
traits. Whence descent with adaptive modification, i.e.,
evolution. Evolution by random heritable variation and natural
selection will explain ever increasing adaptation to given
environments, increasing diversity in the occupation of new
environments, and the complexity of organisms and their parts as their
lineages adapt to one another and to their environments.</p>

<p>

But what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances
fitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than
another? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long
claimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define
fitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the
principle of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that
those organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring
is an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power. In
the century and a half since the publication of <em>On the Origin of
Species</em> biologists have all too often reinforced this objection
by actually so defining fitness. For example, C.H. Waddington writes,
in <em>Towards a Theoretical Biology</em> (1968, 19), that the fittest
individuals are those that are &ldquo;most effective in leaving
gametes to the next generation.&rdquo; It appears therefore that
evolutionary theory requires a definition of fitness that will protect
it from the charges of tautology, triviality, unfalsifiabilty, and
consequent explanatory infirmity. If no such definition is in fact
forthcoming, then what is required by the theory&rsquo;s adherents is
an alternative account of its structure and content or its role in the
research program of biology.</p>

In an intuitive sense, &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; can refer to the
correspondence between the shape of an object and an empty volume it is
placed in: a square peg fits into a square hole. In a more abstract
fashion, one might refer to the properties of an entity and how they
correspond to the constraints of its context. In a biological setting
one could focus on an organism&rsquo;s traits and how they correspond
to various aspects of the environment the organism is living
in. Following biological usage, call this concept &lsquo;ecological
fitness&rsquo;. (It has also been called &lsquo;vernacular
fitness,&rsquo; cf. Matthen and Ariew 2002.) The
&lsquo;vernacular&rsquo; definition is fraught with
difficulties. Suppose, following Dennett (1995) we characterize the
relation &lsquo;\(x\) is fitter than \(y\)&rsquo; as follows:</p>

<blockquote> 

\(x\) is fitter than \(y\) if and only if \(x\)&rsquo;s
traits enable it to solve the &lsquo;design problems&rsquo; set by the
environment more fully than \(y\)&rsquo;s traits do.</blockquote>
