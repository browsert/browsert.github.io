        Astronauts venturing to the moon or Mars in the future are likely to face a barrage of hazardous space 
        radiation during their trips, including high-energy particles and nuclei known as cosmic rays. To protect 
        crews, one NIAC study is exploring the idea of what the project’s lead, Elena D‘Onghia at the University of
         Wisconsin-Madison, calls a “deployable magnetic shield device”. The CREW HaT system would consist of a ring 
         of electrical coils positioned on arms roughly 5 metres from the spacecraft’s main body. When turned on, the
          system would form “an extended magnetic field outside the spacecraft that deflects the cosmic radiation”, s
          ays D’Onghia.
