        Ramon Llull (1232&ndash;1316) is an amazing figure in the field of
        philosophy during the Middle Ages. He is currently recognized as the
        author of <em>Ars Magna</em>, a combining logical system to discover
        the truth, conceived as an instrument to be used in interfaith
        dialogue to convert infidels. In the <em>Ars</em> Llull&rsquo;s
        theological, metaphysical, and logical conceptions are amply
        illustrated, and they were developed throughout his more than 200
        written works in Catalan, Arabic, and Latin. He is known for being
        among the first authors to use his vernacular language, Catalan, to
        communicate his thought.</p>

<p>
Ramon Llull (also called Raymond Lully or Raymond Lull; in Latin,
Raimundus or Raymundus Lullus or Lullius) lead an exceptional and
extraordinarily fruitful life, unusually long for a medieval man,
filled with adventures and guided by his philosophical, religious, and
political convictions, which invariably permeated his work. He was
born in Majorca in 1232, possibly in 1233. His parents, Ramon Amat
Llull and Isabel d&rsquo;Erill, were members of a bourgeois
middle-class family in Barcelona. In 1229 they encouraged and
financed, alongside other Catalan merchants, the efforts of King James
I of Aragon to conquer the island of Majorca, at that time under
Muslim dominion, in exchange for land and privileges. Following the
triumph over the Moors, they received lands and moved to the island.
Ramon, their only son, was born there only a few years later.</p>

<p>
Very little is known about his early life. The main source regarding
Llull&rsquo;s life, the anonymous <em>De vita coaetanea</em>, is a
text written in 1311 by a friend of his in Paris. Apparently based on
his memories, it states that Llull was a seneschal and major of the
palace of King James II during his youth. However, contemporary
studies by Dominguez Reboiras and Gay&aacute; (2008) have established
that the &ldquo;Llulls of Majorca never held nor were they awarded the
social status of nobles&rdquo; (2008: 21). Ramon Llull must have
actually spent the early years of his life as a young bourgeois,
having a basic education to meet his needs and dedicating himself to
family business. In 1257 he married Blanca Picany, who belonged to
another Catalan family settled in Majorca, with whom he had two
children, Dom&egrave;nec and Magdalena.</p>

<h3 id="ConvForm">1.1 Conversion and formation</h3>

<p>
The process through which Ramon Llull was converted to Christianity is
narrated in <em>De vita coaetanea</em> I-4: Llull was writing &ldquo;a
song to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love&rdquo; (and was not
his wife) when he saw an apparition of Christ on the Cross. This
vision would not be enough for him to fully understand and embrace the
calling. Thus, it would be repeated another four times while he
continued to attempt to write the aforementioned love song. Finally,
the voice of</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
his conscience told him that they (the apparitions) could only mean
that he should abandon the world at once and from then on dedicate
himself totally to the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. (<em>De
Vita</em> I&ndash;4. Translation Anthony Bonner)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The call to faith was accompanied by a decision to dedicate his life
to the service of God. That moment is recalled in <em>De vita
coaetanea</em>, where he reflected on the way in
which he could serve God and conceived an action plan that outlined
three main objectives: in converting unbelievers to Christ, in writing
books against the errors of the infidels, and in funding monasteries
in which the different languages necessary for this mission could be
taught.</p>
